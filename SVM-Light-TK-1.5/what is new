The major difference with the description of the SVM-light-tk-1.2 is that you can specify trees like

         A
      /   |  \
     a   b  c

with the following syntax:

(A (a)(b)(c))

Pay attention!! you cannot write such tree as (A a b c).

Actually, you cannot do this with all the my versions too.

With -L option you can change lambda as usual.

With -M you can change mu.

You can use TK with the command

./svm_learn -t 5 -F 3 -C T learning_file model

-F decides the type of tree kernel

	-1	SSTK kernel ACL07 // Moschtti et al. 2007
	0	ST kernel NISP2001 // Wisnathan and Smola 2002
	1	SST kernel // COLLINS and DUFFY 2002
	2	SST kenel + bow kernel on leaves, i.e. SST until the leaves // ZHANG, 2003
	3	PT kernel // Moschitti, ECML 2006
	4	PT kernel no leaves // something new
	6	// STRING_KERNEL, Taylor and Cristianini book 2004, you put a fake root and only one level of children, i.e. the elements of your sequence

If you specify -C V you use only vectors and with -C + you sum tree kernels to vectors (see http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/Tree-Kernel.htm)
